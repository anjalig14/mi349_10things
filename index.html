            <h3>Dynamic Sketching</h3> 
            <p> In Peter Han's dynamic sketching master class, he mentions to challenge your brain with <br>
                the different techniques and build line confidence. Through the class he demonstrates these <br>
                points through basic handling in sketches of lines, arcs, waves and also shows elliptical <br>
                sketching without guides. Below I've included a couple of my sketches that combine the techniques <br>
                he has taught about dynamic sketching. </p>

            <h3>Key Elements & Principles of Visual Design</h3>
            <p> Fundamental elements of visual design are basic tools that designers use in their work. <br>
                These elements include lines, shapes, negative space, volume, value, color, and texture. <br>
                These building blocks can be found in all products. In order to help us understand how <br>
                these elements should go together, we turn to design principles to guide us. These include <br>
                unity, gestalt, hierarchy, balance, contrast, scale, and dominance. </p>
